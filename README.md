# Description
The web page represents a brief info about me. It was made as a pretask for JS course from EPAM.
### PS. The interface is in russian!
## How to open
You can simply observe it using github pages link.
## What it does
The field number is made to check the phone number you print. It has to match pattern '+37544.......'. 
If it doesn't then the page shows an according alert message after pressing the button "Проверить". 
If the number is typed correctly then you'll see an according alert message and the comment field will be filled 
with my e-mail adress (if it was empty, but if it wasn't then you will simply see your message).
